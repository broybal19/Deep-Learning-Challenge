# Deep Learning Background and Results

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze and evaluate the performance of a charity funding organization by compiling, training, and evaluating the neural network model.

##Processing
A CSV containing data on more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years was provided.

Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed by:

1. Dropping columns that were not beneficial
2. Cleaning the APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION data 
3. Convert categorical data to numeric
4. Arranged the data for target array and features array
5. Create a testing and training dataset

Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
The accuracy goal for the model was predicted for greater than 75%. Three attempts were made using the neural networks. They all resulted in around a 72% accuracy, which falls short for the target accuracy.

## Conclusion
After attempting optimization of the model, I did not succeed in achieving accuracy above 72.59%.. I suggest using a different classification model to predict the funding success for the charity.
